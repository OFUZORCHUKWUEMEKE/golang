// Code only executes line-by-line , one line at a time

// Two types of concurrent code
//  - Threaded : Code runs in parralel based on numbers of CPU cores
//  - Asynchronous : code can pause and resume execution
// Single threaded code runs deterministically
//  concurrent code runs undeterministically
